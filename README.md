# Bad-Sky-Cab

This project is a sidescroller in a down-on-it's luck futuristic city. The player pilots a flying taxi to it's destination 
somewhere far to the right.  Motion of the player vehicle, motion of the screen, obstacles, and a compelling backdrop are essential. Enemy obstacles 
and power-ups are not essential but strongly-desired. A retro opening text box or scroll would be ideal but will follow fuctional implementation of core game mechanics.

HTML5, Canvas, and JavaScript should provide the necessities for the project. 

By end of Thursday, September 27th I should have a sprite on screen that the player is able to control. By end of day Friday, September 28th, obstacles such as skyscrapers, flying billboards and stray balloon men should impede and or destroy our cab man.
