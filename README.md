# Bad-Sky-Cab

This project is an airborne sidescroller in a city of the future. Zoom past towering structures, avoid speeding delivery trucks and head onwards ever to the right!. The player pilots a flying taxi to it's destination 
somewhere far to the right. 

A future feature to implement will be fares with dialoge boxes. A small icon indicating a person, a blurb of text with items pulled from a career array and a destination array("I'm a robotics tycoon and need to get to the cheese zeppelin-resturant") on pickup.  with destinations always either being a building, a floater platform, or an entertainment dirigible based on a randomized decision at pickup. Once the mechanics are set a transition in background(from run-down to upscale cloud apartments or rural) would deepen immersion. A retro opening text box or scroll would be ideal but will follow fuctional implementation of core game mechanics.
